# recap python duck typing 



# dynamically typed. as we do not need to specify the type of the variable just like
# c or c++ or java. 
# as c type language needs to specify the type of the variable at the compile time, 
# but in python the type is dynamically decided at the run time or interpreter time.
# as we do not need to specify the type of the variable, this is called as dynamically typed language.
# and as we need to specify the type of  the variable at the compile time for c type language, we call it as statically typed language.
